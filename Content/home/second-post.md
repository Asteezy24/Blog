# About myself!

Hello everyone! My name is Alex Stevens, and I decided to do what a million other people have already done. Start a Swift blog. I feel this will be a good way to advance my iOS domain knowledge, as well as serve as a point of reference for future job interviews. I plan to cover all aspects of iOS Development from Computer Science algorithms, to App Extensions, to SwiftUI/Combine.

I hope everyone joins me in on this journey, and I hope this will be a good resource to any iOS Engineer out there, no matter what part of your journey you are on. From a new grad, or a seasoned engineer looking to crack into the mobile development space, welcome!

--Alex

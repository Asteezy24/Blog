I started out like most other engineers did. Tinkering with things as a child. I loved Lego's, I loved building things, and learning how they
worked. I would take apart remote controls, radios, anything I could get my hands on and would take them apart, and try to put them back together. Sorry Mom ðŸ˜„. Around age 11 I taught myself
how to jailbreak my iPod Touch and that was my introduction into the world of everything Apple. I was fascinated and definitely fell down the rabbit hole! I did not get into more consistent
programming until high school, where I dove into web development. I bounced around in college from databases, to python scripting, etc until I revisited my passion for iOS development.
I had a capstone project where the assignment was to 'Create Something'. So I decided to make a full fledged iOS app and put it into the app store. It was a simple weather app which had some fancy animations,
transitions, and made a singluar API call. But I was very proud of myself for completing a project like that. Its still available on the app store for those curious, under the name "XenoWeathr".</p><br/><p>I finished college with 2 bachelors degrees, in Computer Science and Software Egnineering. While I was in school I interned as an iOS developer at J.P. Morgan Chase and was lucky enough to receive an offer
for full time employment there. I worked at Chase for roughly 4 years where I learned iOS development at a large scale. I learned MVVM architecture, Unit Testing, UIKit essentials and more. I plan to cover all
the things I have learned (and the things I continue to learn) as a part of this blog.</p><br/><p>In 2021, I was on the job hunt again and accepted a job offer for iOS development on the DoorDash app. It is a new chapter for me, and I could not be more excited!

Cheers! and thank you to each and every one of you who reads my story.
